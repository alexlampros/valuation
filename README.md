## Summery
Elanders AB is fairly valued. The company generates both positive economic value from operations and healthy cashflow.
The company's reliance on debt is becoming a concern. ROE is primarily propped up by the company's leverage factor, and not by profits or asset utilization. Given the a 67% total debt ratio and a 2x interest coverage ratio, this is not sustainable. The company should focus on operational efficiency and improve asset turnover to sustain ROE.
