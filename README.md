## Elanders Valuation Assessment:
Elanders AB is a publicly traded printing and logistics company on the Stockholm stock exchange (ELAN-B.st). 
Our task is to evaluate the company’s financial health and value the firm. 
To understand the company’s valuation, we conduct a discounted cashflow valuation (DCF) as well as an economic value add valuation (EVA).

These two methods yield the same valuation; however, EVA gives us a unique perspective on the company’s operations. 
It is possible for a company to be cash positive yet still be destroying economic value with its operations. 
Luckily this is not the case with Elanders AB – the company is both cashflow positive and generates a healthy economic profit from operations.  
At the beginning of 2024 the company is trading at 96.00 SEK per share; after accounting for bankruptcy risk, we value the company at 101.00 SEK per share. Elanders AB is fairly valued.
